Prompt: Build the JSSKYLINE Website (Next.js, Dark-Mode, Animated, Responsive)

SYSTEM / ROLE
You are a senior brand designer + full-stack engineer. Produce a production-ready website for JSSKYLINE using Next.js 14 (App Router) + React + TypeScript + Tailwind + Framer Motion. Follow the brand system and animation specs below exactly. When something is unspecified, propose a sensible default and state it.

1) Brand Inputs (use verbatim)

Name: JSSKYLINE (preferred printed form: JS SKYLINE)

Primary tagline: PERSPECTIVE WITH PURPOSE.

Mission (Shakespearean flavor): Where art and utility ascend together—mounted aloft where men may see.

Identity: Hybrid imaging brand; drone-first (Mavic 4 Pro visuals, inspections, mapping, remote monitoring) + studio (macro/food/product), stitched macro panoramas, 12K capability.

Voice: Expert, approachable, outcome-oriented.

Color Palette (dark theme)

Primary Blue #3EB6F1

Accent Blue #0B4C8B

Sky Light Blue #B8ECFF

White #FFFFFF

Ashen Black #1C1C1E (background)

Highlight Orange #FF9023 (thin pinlines/CTAs only)

Logo / Mark Guidance

All-caps, tall condensed sans. Oversized “JS S”; remainder “KYLINE” at ~1/3 size, baseline-aligned.

Thin orange pinline around large letterforms (target 1.0–1.5% of cap height; 0.6–0.8% at small sizes).

Secondary mark: Mavic 4 Pro silhouette at 45° low angle, rounded gimbal, no overhanging sensors.

Add subtle white edge highlight on dark if needed.

Typography

Display/Headlines: Tall, condensed sans (choose one: Anton / Oswald / Bebas Neue) via next/font.

Body/UI: Inter or Montserrat via next/font.

Headline tracking +10–30; body tracking 0–10.

Presentation context: Must look superb on 4K 16:9 (INNOCN portable monitor) and on mobile.

2) Objectives & Constraints

Make the drone identity obvious, while also showcasing macro/food/product and fine-art work.

Dark-mode first: Sky Light Blue text on Ashen Black, Primary/Accent Blue for emphasis, Orange pinline for borders/CTAs.

Animated and responsive across breakpoints; respect prefers-reduced-motion.

Performance: Lighthouse ≥ 95 (Perf/Access/Best/SEO).

Accessibility: WCAG 2.2 AA; keyboard nav; focus states; alt text; adequate contrast.

SEO & Sharing: Proper <title>/meta, canonical, sitemap.xml, robots.txt, OpenGraph/Twitter cards, and JSON-LD (Organization, Service, VideoObject, ImageObject).

Compliance: FAA-aware language where applicable; privacy + terms pages.

3) Signature Animation — “Reverse-Scroll” Hero (Required)

Goal: When the user scrolls down, the hero behaves like a reverse reveal:

The content appears from the top (revealed downward) while a thin vertical pinline on the right edge fills upward (from bottom to top).

The section is sticky/pinned for ~200–220vh to give room for the sequence.

Implementation requirements (Framer Motion):

Use useScroll + useTransform.

Container: sticky top-0 full-viewport; parent section spans ~200–220vh.

Reveal: Use a clip-path mask whose top inset goes from ~100% → 0% as scroll progresses. Optionally add a small downward y translation easing to the content.

Pinline: Absolutely positioned 1px vertical rule at right; inner bar’s height animates from 0% → 100%, anchored to bottom. Color: #FF9023.

Video background: 4K orbit shot (muted, looped) with static poster fallback + subtle gradient overlay for legibility.

Reduced motion: Disable clip-mask animation; show fully revealed hero; pinline remains static at 100%.

No inverted OS scrolling—we simulate reverse reveal via animation; scrolling direction remains standard.

4) Information Architecture

Top-level nav: Home, Services (menu), Portfolio, About, Contact

Services subpages (1 page each):

Aerial Marketing & Real Estate

Inspections & Construction Monitoring (incl. Teams/Zoom workflow)

Mapping & Site Visualization (orthos, overlays)

Legal & Investigative (evidence-ready imagery, metadata, chain-of-custody notes)

Studio: Macro / Food / Product / Fine-Art

Other pages: Case Studies (optional), FAQ, Blog/Notes (optional), Privacy, Terms.

5) Page Copy (write on-brand text)

Home (hero first-screen)

H1: “JSSKYLINE”

Subline: “Aerial-Crafted Imaging for Land, Table, and Industry.”

Tagline lockup: “PERSPECTIVE WITH PURPOSE.”

Primary CTAs: Explore Services / Request a Quote

Below the fold: 4 value pillars (Elevated Vision / Detailed Craft / Technical Rigor / Client-Ready Delivery) + teaser portfolio strip + testimonial carousel + CTA banner.

Services pages (each):

Short intro paragraph (benefit-driven).

“Where it helps” bullets (use-cases by industry).

Deliverables list + process overview (scope → plan → capture → post → handoff).

2–3 mini case blurbs (problem → approach → result).

CTA panel.

Portfolio:

Filter chips: Aerial / Macro / Food / Fine-Art / Legal / Mapping.

Support MP4/HLS video, WebP/AVIF stills, and before/after slider.

Each item: title, short brief, services used, equipment tags, outcome.

About:

Brand story; Shakespeare line; approach; highlight gear + safety/compliance.

Contact:

Multi-step form: name, company, email/phone, service interest (multi-select), location/date window, message, optional file upload.

reCAPTCHA v3 (or anti-bot); API route stub + success/fail states.

Write all copy in JSSKYLINE’s voice: confident, cinematic, practical, outcome-oriented.

6) Tech Stack & Coding Standards (generate code)

Next.js 14 (App Router) + React + TS

Tailwind CSS with design tokens for palette + typography

Framer Motion for hero and micro-interactions; optional Lenis for smooth scroll

next/font for Display (Anton/Oswald/Bebas) + Body (Inter/Montserrat)

Next/Image with AVIF/WebP, lazy loading; priority for hero

Route transitions using Framer Motion

Contact API route that logs payload (and explains how to add email/webhook later)

Performance: code-split galleries; server components where possible; preconnect/preload hero media; image sizes tuned per breakpoint.

Accessibility: semantic landmarks, logical tab order, visible focus rings, alt text examples; animation obeys prefers-reduced-motion.

7) What to Deliver (as your final answer)

Return all files as path-labeled code blocks, plus a short README. Include:

Project tree (folders/files).

Design tokens: /app/theme/tokens.ts exporting colors, spacing, fonts.

Global styles: /app/globals.css (Tailwind base + small utilities).

App Router pages:

/app/page.tsx (Home with the reverse-scroll hero)

/app/services/(category)/page.tsx for each service

/app/portfolio/page.tsx (with filterable gallery stub)

/app/about/page.tsx

/app/contact/page.tsx (multi-step form)

/app/api/contact/route.ts (POST handler that logs form data)

Core components in /components:

HeroReverse.tsx (implements the pinned section, clip-mask reveal, upward pinline)

Header.tsx, Footer.tsx, Section.tsx, CTA.tsx, Card.tsx, Gallery.tsx, BeforeAfter.tsx

RouteTransition.tsx (page transitions)

LogoLockup.tsx (optional)

SEO utilities: /lib/seo.ts and /lib/schema.ts with JSON-LD helpers (Organization, Service, VideoObject, ImageObject).

Static files: /public/video/hero.mp4 (placeholder path), /public/poster/hero.jpg, /public/img/* samples.

Config: tailwind.config.ts, postcss.config.js, tsconfig.json, next.config.mjs.

Meta files: sitemap.xml, robots.txt.

README.md with build/run/deploy instructions (Vercel) and how to replace hero media.

Important:

The reverse-scroll hero must be fully implemented and ready to run.

Use the orange pinline #FF9023 at 1–2px for the hero progress and thin section dividers.

Respect brand palette and typography everywhere.

Include sample copy that fits the brand; avoid lorem ipsum.

8) Acceptance Criteria

Dark-mode site, responsive from mobile → 4K.

Reverse-scroll hero works: content reveals from the top; orange pinline fills upward; sticky section spans ~200–220vh; graceful reduced-motion fallback.

Pages and components compile and run with pnpm i && pnpm dev (or npm).

Lighthouse ≥ 95 across categories on a typical project page.
